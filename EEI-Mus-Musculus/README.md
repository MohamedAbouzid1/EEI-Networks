### EEI in Mus Musculus

In this folder it's contained all the necessary for building EEI-networks for Mus Musculus data collected in 2024.

It should contain three folders, each collecting scripts for each of the three methods used in the reference paper: Contact-based, Energy-based, Evolution-based.

At the moment only the Contact-based analysis has been performed and so it's visible.

An additional folder, named Homology-analysis, collects scripts for detection of homologous exons of Homo Sapiens and Mus musculus.
