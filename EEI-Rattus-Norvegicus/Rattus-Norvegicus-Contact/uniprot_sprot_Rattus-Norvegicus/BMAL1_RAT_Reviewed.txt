CC   -!- FUNCTION: Transcriptional activator which forms a core component of the
CC       circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system,
CC       regulates various physiological processes through the generation of
CC       approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are
CC       translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from
CC       the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an
CC       important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions
CC       including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure,
CC       endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two
CC       major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic
CC       nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present
CC       in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and
CC       peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as
CC       Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the
CC       central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly
CC       to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through
CC       neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related
CC       cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian
CC       rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its
CC       environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to
CC       create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when
CC       a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the
CC       solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components
CC       (CLOCK, NPAS2, BMAL1, BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a
CC       critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-
CC       translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the
CC       period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and
CC       is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is
CC       synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and
CC       infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,
CC       respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the
CC       pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and
CC       aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core
CC       of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors,
CC       CLOCK or NPAS2 and BMAL1 or BMAL2, form the positive limb of the
CC       feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the
CC       transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved
CC       in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3')
CC       within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which
CC       are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback
CC       loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-BMAL1|BMAL2 heterodimer
CC       inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own
CC       expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2
CC       and RORA/B/G, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and
CC       repress BMAL1 transcription, respectively. BMAL1 positively regulates
CC       myogenesis and negatively regulates adipogenesis via the
CC       transcriptional control of the genes of the canonical Wnt signaling
CC       pathway. Plays a role in normal pancreatic beta-cell function;
CC       regulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion via the regulation of
CC       antioxidant genes NFE2L2/NRF2 and its targets SESN2, PRDX3, CCLC and
CC       CCLM. Negatively regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway; regulates the
CC       expression of MTOR and DEPTOR. Controls diurnal oscillations of Ly6C
CC       inflammatory monocytes; rhythmic recruitment of the PRC2 complex
CC       imparts diurnal variation to chemokine expression that is necessary to
CC       sustain Ly6C monocyte rhythms. Regulates the expression of HSD3B2,
CC       STAR, PTGS2, CYP11A1, CYP19A1 and LHCGR in the ovary and also the genes
CC       involved in hair growth. Plays an important role in adult hippocampal
CC       neurogenesis by regulating the timely entry of neural stem/progenitor
CC       cells (NSPCs) into the cell cycle and the number of cell divisions that
CC       take place prior to cell-cycle exit. Regulates the circadian expression
CC       of CIART and KLF11. The CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer regulates the circadian
CC       expression of SERPINE1/PAI1, VWF, B3, CCRN4L/NOC, NAMPT, DBP, MYOD1,
CC       PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B, SIRT1, GYS2, F7, NGFR, GNRHR, BHLHE40/DEC1, ATF4,
CC       MTA1, KLF10 and also genes implicated in glucose and lipid metabolism.
CC       Promotes rhythmic chromatin opening, regulating the DNA accessibility
CC       of other transcription factors. May play a role in spermatogenesis;
CC       contributes to the chromatoid body assembly and physiology. The NPAS2-
CC       BMAL1 heterodimer positively regulates the expression of MAOA, F7 and
CC       LDHA and modulates the circadian rhythm of daytime contrast sensitivity
CC       by regulating the rhythmic expression of adenylate cyclase type 1
CC       (ADCY1) in the retina. The preferred binding motif for the CLOCK-BMAL1
CC       heterodimer is 5'-CACGTGA-3', which contains a flanking adenine
CC       nucleotide at the 3-prime end of the canonical 6-nucleotide E-box
CC       sequence (By similarity). CLOCK specifically binds to the half-site 5'-
CC       CAC-3', while BMAL1 binds to the half-site 5'-GTGA-3' (By similarity).
CC       The CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer also recognizes the non-canonical E-box
CC       motifs 5'-AACGTGA-3' and 5'-CATGTGA-3'. Essential for the rhythmic
CC       interaction of CLOCK with ASS1 and plays a critical role in positively
CC       regulating CLOCK-mediated acetylation of ASS1 (By similarity). Plays a
CC       role in protecting against lethal sepsis by limiting the expression of
CC       immune checkpoint protein CD274 in macrophages in a PKM2-dependent
CC       manner (By similarity). Regulates the diurnal rhythms of skeletal
CC       muscle metabolism via transcriptional activation of genes promoting
CC       triglyceride synthesis (DGAT2) and metabolic efficiency (COQ10B) (By
CC       similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O00327,

CC       Deubiquitinated by USP9X. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9WTL8}.
CC   -!- PTM: O-glycosylated; contains O-GlcNAc. O-glycosylation by OGT prevents
CC       protein degradation by inhibiting ubiquitination. It also stabilizes
CC       the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer thereby increasing CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated

CC       as PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9WTL8}.
CC   -!- PTM: Acetylated on Lys-538 by CLOCK during the repression phase of the
CC       circadian cycle. Acetylation facilitates recruitment of CRY1 protein
CC       and initiates the repression phase of the circadian cycle. Acetylated
CC       at Lys-538 by KAT5 during the activation phase of the cycle, leading to
CC       recruitment of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb)
CC       and BRD4, followed by productive elongation of circadian transcripts.
CC       Deacetylated by SIRT1, which may result in decreased protein stability.
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9WTL8}.
CC   -!- PTM: Phosphorylated upon dimerization with CLOCK. Phosphorylation
CC       enhances the transcriptional activity, alters the subcellular
CC       localization and decreases the stability of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer
CC       by promoting its degradation. Phosphorylation shows circadian
CC       variations in the liver with a peak between CT10 to CT14.
CC       Phosphorylation at Ser-90 by CK2 is essential for its nuclear
CC       localization, its interaction with CLOCK and controls CLOCK nuclear
CC       entry. Dephosphorylation at Ser-78 is important for dimerization with
CC       CLOCK and transcriptional activity. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O00327,

CC       localizes it exclusively to the PML body and promotes its
CC       ubiquitination in the PML body, ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal
CC       degradation and the transcriptional activity of the CLOCK-BMAL1
CC       heterodimer. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9WTL8}.
