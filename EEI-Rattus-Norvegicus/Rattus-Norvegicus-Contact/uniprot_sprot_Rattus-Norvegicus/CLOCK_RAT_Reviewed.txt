CC   -!- FUNCTION: Transcriptional activator which forms a core component of the
CC       circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system,
CC       regulates various physiological processes through the generation of
CC       approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are
CC       translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from
CC       the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an
CC       important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions
CC       including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure,
CC       endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two
CC       major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic
CC       nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present
CC       in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and
CC       peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as
CC       Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the
CC       central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly
CC       to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through
CC       neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related
CC       cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian
CC       rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its
CC       environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to
CC       create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when
CC       a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the
CC       solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components
CC       (CLOCK, NPAS2, BMAL1, BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a
CC       critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-
CC       translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the
CC       period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and
CC       is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is
CC       synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and
CC       infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,
CC       respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the
CC       pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and
CC       aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core
CC       of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors,
CC       CLOCK or NPAS2 and BMAL1 or BMAL2, form the positive limb of the
CC       feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the
CC       transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved
CC       in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3')
CC       within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which
CC       are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback
CC       loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-BMAL1|BMAL2 heterodimer
CC       inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own
CC       expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2
CC       and RORA/B/G, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and
CC       repress BMAL1 transcription, respectively. Regulates the circadian
CC       expression of ICAM1, VCAM1, CCL2, THPO and MPL and also acts as an
CC       enhancer of the transactivation potential of NF-kappaB. Plays an
CC       important role in the homeostatic regulation of sleep. The CLOCK-BMAL1
CC       heterodimer regulates the circadian expression of SERPINE1/PAI1, VWF,
CC       B3, CCRN4L/NOC, NAMPT, DBP, MYOD1, PPARGC1A, PPARGC1B, SIRT1, GYS2, F7,
CC       NGFR, GNRHR, BHLHE40/DEC1, ATF4, MTA1, KLF10 and also genes implicated
CC       in glucose and lipid metabolism. Promotes rhythmic chromatin opening,
CC       regulating the DNA accessibility of other transcription factors. The
CC       CLOCK-BMAL2 heterodimer activates the transcription of SERPINE1/PAI1
CC       and BHLHE40/DEC1. The preferred binding motif for the CLOCK-BMAL1
CC       heterodimer is 5'-CACGTGA-3', which contains a flanking adenine
CC       nucleotide at the 3-prime end of the canonical 6-nucleotide E-box
CC       sequence. CLOCK specifically binds to the half-site 5'-CAC-3', while
CC       BMAL1 binds to the half-site 5'-GTGA-3'. The CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer
CC       also recognizes the non-canonical E-box motifs 5'-AACGTGA-3' and 5'-
CC       CATGTGA-3'. CLOCK has an intrinsic acetyltransferase activity, which
CC       enables circadian chromatin remodeling by acetylating histones and
CC       nonhistone proteins, including its own partner BMAL1. Represses
CC       glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activity by
CC       reducing the association of NR3C1/GR to glucocorticoid response
CC       elements (GREs) via the acetylation of multiple lysine residues located
CC       in its hinge region. The acetyltransferase activity of CLOCK is as
CC       important as its transcription activity in circadian control.
CC       Acetylates metabolic enzymes IMPDH2 and NDUFA9 in a circadian manner.
CC       Facilitated by BMAL1, rhythmically interacts and acetylates
CC       argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) leading to enzymatic inhibition of
CC       ASS1 as well as the circadian oscillation of arginine biosynthesis and
CC       subsequent ureagenesis (By similarity). Drives the circadian rhythm of
CC       blood pressure through transcriptional activation of ATP1B1 (By
CC       similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08785,

CC   -!- INDUCTION: Without light exposure, high levels at ZT6 and low levels at

CC   -!- PTM: Ubiquitinated, leading to its proteasomal degradation.
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08785}.
CC   -!- PTM: O-glycosylated; contains O-GlcNAc. O-glycosylation by OGT prevents
CC       protein degradation by inhibiting ubiquitination. It also stabilizes
CC       the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer thereby increasing CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated
CC       transcriptional activation of PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2.
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08785}.
CC   -!- PTM: Phosphorylation is dependent on the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer
CC       formation. Phosphorylation enhances the transcriptional activity,
CC       alters the subcellular localization and decreases the stability of the
CC       heterodimer by promoting its degradation. Phosphorylation shows
CC       circadian variations in the liver. May be phosphorylated by CSNK1D and
CC       CKSN1E. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08785}.
CC   -!- PTM: Sumoylation enhances its transcriptional activity and interaction
CC       with ESR1, resulting in up-regulation of ESR1 activity. Estrogen
CC       stimulates sumoylation. Desumoylation by SENP1 negatively regulates its
CC       transcriptional activity. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08785}.
CC   -!- PTM: Undergoes lysosome-mediated degradation in a time-dependent manner
CC       in the liver. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O08785}.
