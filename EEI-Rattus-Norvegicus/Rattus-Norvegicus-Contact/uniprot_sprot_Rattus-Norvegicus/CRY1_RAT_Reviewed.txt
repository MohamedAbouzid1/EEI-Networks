CC   -!- FUNCTION: Transcriptional repressor which forms a core component of the
CC       circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system,
CC       regulates various physiological processes through the generation of
CC       approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are
CC       translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from
CC       the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an
CC       important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions
CC       including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure,
CC       endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two
CC       major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic
CC       nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present
CC       in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and
CC       peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as
CC       Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the
CC       central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly
CC       to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through
CC       neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related
CC       cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian
CC       rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its
CC       environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to
CC       create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when
CC       a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the
CC       solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components
CC       (CLOCK, NPAS2, BMAL1, BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a
CC       critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-
CC       translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the
CC       period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and
CC       is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is
CC       synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and
CC       infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,
CC       respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the
CC       pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and
CC       aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core
CC       of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors,
CC       CLOCK or NPAS2 and BMAL1 or BMAL2, form the positive limb of the
CC       feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the
CC       transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved
CC       in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3')
CC       within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which
CC       are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback
CC       loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-BMAL1|BMAL2 heterodimer
CC       inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own
CC       expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2
CC       and RORA/B/G, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and
CC       repress BMAL1 transcription, respectively. CRY1 and CRY2 have redundant
CC       functions but also differential and selective contributions at least in
CC       defining the pace of the SCN circadian clock and its circadian
CC       transcriptional outputs. More potent transcriptional repressor in
CC       cerebellum and liver than CRY2, though more effective in lengthening
CC       the period of the SCN oscillator. On its side, CRY2 seems to play a
CC       critical role in tuning SCN circadian period by opposing the action of
CC       CRY1. With CRY2, is dispensable for circadian rhythm generation but
CC       necessary for the development of intercellular networks for rhythm
CC       synchrony. Capable of translocating circadian clock core proteins such
CC       as PER proteins to the nucleus. Interacts with CLOCK-BMAL1
CC       independently of PER proteins and is found at CLOCK-BMAL1-bound sites,
CC       suggesting that CRY may act as a molecular gatekeeper to maintain
CC       CLOCK-BMAL1 in a poised and repressed state until the proper time for
CC       transcriptional activation. Represses the CLOCK-BMAL1 induced
CC       transcription of BHLHE40/DEC1, ATF4, MTA1, KLF10 and NAMPT. May repress
CC       circadian target genes expression in collaboration with HDAC1 and HDAC2
CC       through histone deacetylation. Mediates the clock-control activation of
CC       ATR and modulates ATR-mediated DNA damage checkpoint. In liver,
CC       mediates circadian regulation of cAMP signaling and gluconeogenesis by
CC       binding to membrane-coupled G proteins and blocking glucagon-mediated
CC       increases in intracellular cAMP concentrations and CREB1
CC       phosphorylation. Inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis by decreasing nuclear
CC       FOXO1 levels that down-regulates gluconeogenic gene expression. Besides
CC       its role in the maintenance of the circadian clock, is also involved in
CC       the regulation of other processes. Represses glucocorticoid receptor
CC       NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activity by binding to glucocorticoid
CC       response elements (GREs). Plays a key role in glucose and lipid
CC       metabolism modulation, in part, through the transcriptional regulation
CC       of genes involved in these pathways, such as LEP or ACSL4 (By
CC       similarity). Represses PPARD and its target genes in the skeletal
CC       muscle and limits exercise capacity (By similarity). Plays an essential
CC       role in the generation of circadian rhythms in the retina (By
CC       similarity). Represses the transcriptional activity of NR1I2 (By
CC       similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97784,

CC       through interaction with other clock proteins such as PER2 or BMAL1.
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97784}.
CC   -!- INDUCTION: Expression is regulated by light and circadian rhythms. Peak
CC       expression in the suprachiasma nucleus (SCN) and eye at the day/night
CC       transition (CT12). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15529004}.
CC   -!- DOMAIN: The LIR motifs (LC3-interacting region) 3 and 5 are required
CC       for its interaction with MAP1LC3B and for its autophagy-mediated
CC       degradation. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97784}.
CC   -!- PTM: Phosphorylation on Ser-247 by MAPK is important for the inhibition
CC       of CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation by
CC       CSNK1E requires interaction with PER1 or PER2. Phosphorylation at Ser-
CC       71 and Ser-280 by AMPK decreases protein stability. Phosphorylation at
CC       Ser-570 exhibits a robust circadian rhythm with a peak at CT8,
CC       increases protein stability, prevents SCF(FBXL3)-mediated degradation
CC       and is antagonized by interaction with PRKDC (By similarity).
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97784}.
CC   -!- PTM: Ubiquitinated by the SCF(FBXL3) and SCF(FBXL21) complexes,
CC       regulating the balance between degradation and stabilization (By
CC       similarity). The SCF(FBXL3) complex is mainly nuclear and mediates
CC       ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of CRY1 (By similarity). In
CC       contrast, cytoplasmic SCF(FBXL21) complex-mediated ubiquitination leads
CC       to stabilize CRY1 and counteract the activity of the SCF(FBXL3) complex
CC       (By similarity). The SCF(FBXL3) and SCF(FBXL21) complexes probably
CC       mediate ubiquitination at different Lys residues (By similarity).
CC       Ubiquitination at Lys-11 and Lys-107 are specifically ubiquitinated by
CC       the SCF(FBXL21) complex but not by the SCF(FBXL3) complex (By
CC       similarity). Ubiquitination may be inhibited by PER2 (By similarity).
CC       Deubiquitinated by USP7 (By similarity).
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97784}.
CC   -!- PTM: Undergoes autophagy-mediated degradation in the liver in a time-
CC       dependent manner. Autophagic degradation of CRY1 (an inhibitor of
CC       gluconeogenesis) occurs during periods of reduced feeding allowing
CC       induction of gluconeogenesis and maintenance of blood glucose levels.
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P97784}.
CC   -!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DNA photolyase class-1 family.
