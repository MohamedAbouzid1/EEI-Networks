CC   -!- FUNCTION: Transcriptional repressor which forms a core component of the
CC       circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system,
CC       regulates various physiological processes through the generation of
CC       approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are
CC       translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from
CC       the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an
CC       important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions
CC       including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure,
CC       endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two
CC       major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic
CC       nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present
CC       in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and
CC       peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as
CC       Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the
CC       central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly
CC       to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through
CC       neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related
CC       cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian
CC       rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its
CC       environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to
CC       create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when
CC       a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the
CC       solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components
CC       (CLOCK, NPAS2, BMAL1, BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a
CC       critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-
CC       translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the
CC       period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and
CC       is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is
CC       synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and
CC       infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours,
CC       respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the
CC       pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and
CC       aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core
CC       of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors,
CC       CLOCK or NPAS2 and BMAL1 or BMAL2, form the positive limb of the
CC       feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the
CC       transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved
CC       in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3')
CC       within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which
CC       are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback
CC       loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-BMAL1|BMAL2 heterodimer
CC       inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own
CC       expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2
CC       and RORA/B/G, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and
CC       repress BMAL1 transcription, respectively. CRY1 and CRY2 have redundant
CC       functions but also differential and selective contributions at least in
CC       defining the pace of the SCN circadian clock and its circadian
CC       transcriptional outputs. Less potent transcriptional repressor in
CC       cerebellum and liver than CRY1, though less effective in lengthening
CC       the period of the SCN oscillator. Seems to play a critical role in
CC       tuning SCN circadian period by opposing the action of CRY1. With CRY1,
CC       dispensable for circadian rhythm generation but necessary for the
CC       development of intercellular networks for rhythm synchrony. May mediate
CC       circadian regulation of cAMP signaling and gluconeogenesis by blocking
CC       glucagon-mediated increases in intracellular cAMP concentrations and in
CC       CREB1 phosphorylation. Besides its role in the maintenance of the
CC       circadian clock, is also involved in the regulation of other processes.
CC       Plays a key role in glucose and lipid metabolism modulation, in part,
CC       through the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in these
CC       pathways, such as LEP or ACSL4. Represses glucocorticoid receptor
CC       NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activity by binding to glucocorticoid
CC       response elements (GREs). Represses the CLOCK-BMAL1 induced
CC       transcription of BHLHE40/DEC1 and NAMPT (By similarity). Represses
CC       PPARD and its target genes in the skeletal muscle and limits exercise
CC       capacity (By similarity). Represses the transcriptional activity of
CC       NR1I2 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9R194}.

CC   -!- SUBUNIT: Component of the circadian core oscillator, which includes the
CC       CRY proteins, CLOCK or NPAS2, BMAL1 or BMAL2, CSNK1D and/or CSNK1E,
CC       TIMELESS, and the PER proteins (By similarity). Interacts with TIMELESS
CC       (By similarity). Interacts directly with PER1, PER2 and PER3;
CC       interaction with PER2 inhibits its ubiquitination and vice versa (By
CC       similarity). Interacts with CLOCK-BMAL1 (By similarity). Interacts with
CC       CLOCK (By similarity). Interacts with BMAL1 (By similarity). Interacts
CC       with NFIL3 (By similarity). Interacts with FBXL3 and FBXL21 (By
CC       similarity). FBXL3, PER2 and the cofactor FAD compete for overlapping
CC       binding sites (By similarity). FBXL3 cannot bind CRY2 that interacts
CC       already with PER2 or that contains bound FAD (By similarity). Interacts
CC       with PPP5C (via TPR repeats); the interaction down-regulates the PPP5C
CC       phosphatase activity on CSNK1E (PubMed:16790549). Interacts with
CC       nuclear receptors AR and NR3C1/GR; the interaction is ligand dependent
CC       (By similarity). Interacts with PRKDC and CIART (By similarity).
CC       Interacts with DDB1, USP7 and TARDBP (By similarity). Interacts with
CC       HNF4A and PPARA (By similarity). Interacts with PPARD (via domain NR
CC       LBD) and NR1I2 (via domain NR LBD) in a ligand-dependent manner (By
CC       similarity). Interacts with PPARG, NR1I3 and VDR in a ligand-dependent
CC       manner (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q49AN0,
CC       ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9R194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16790549}.
CC   -!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9R194}. Nucleus
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9R194}. Note=Translocated to the nucleus
CC       through interaction with other Clock proteins such as PER2 or BMAL1.
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9R194}.
CC   -!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in all tissues examined including heart,
CC       cerebellum, cerebral cortex, lung, liver, muscle, kidney and ovary.
CC       Highest levels in heart, liver and ovary. Highly expressed in the
CC       suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11804325}.
CC   -!- PTM: Phosphorylation on Ser-265 by MAPK is important for the inhibition
CC       of CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation by
CC       CSKNe requires interaction with PER1 or PER2. Phosphorylated in a
CC       circadian manner at Ser-553 and Ser-557 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus
CC       (SCN) and liver. Phosphorylation at Ser-557 by DYRK1A promotes
CC       subsequent phosphorylation at Ser-553 by GSK3-beta: the two-step
CC       phosphorylation at the neighboring Ser residues leads to its
CC       proteasomal degradation. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9R194}.
CC   -!- PTM: Ubiquitinated by the SCF(FBXL3) and SCF(FBXL21) complexes,
CC       regulating the balance between degradation and stabilization (By
CC       similarity). The SCF(FBXL3) complex is mainly nuclear and mediates
CC       ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of CRY2 (By similarity). In
CC       contrast, cytoplasmic SCF(FBXL21) complex-mediated ubiquitination leads
CC       to stabilize CRY2 and counteract the activity of the SCF(FBXL3) complex
CC       (By similarity). The SCF(FBXL3) and SCF(FBXL21) complexes probably
CC       mediate ubiquitination at different Lys residues (By similarity). The
CC       SCF(FBXL3) complex recognizes and binds CRY2 phosphorylated at Ser-553
CC       and Ser-557 (By similarity). Ubiquitination may be inhibited by PER2
CC       (By similarity). Deubiquitinated by USP7 (By similarity).
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9R194}.
CC   -!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the DNA photolyase class-1 family.
