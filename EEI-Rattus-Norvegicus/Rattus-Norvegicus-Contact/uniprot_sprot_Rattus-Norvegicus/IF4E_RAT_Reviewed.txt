CC   -!- FUNCTION: Acts in the cytoplasm to initiate and regulate protein
CC       synthesis and is required in the nucleus for export of a subset of
CC       mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm which promotes processes such
CC       as RNA capping, processing and splicing (By similarity). Component of
CC       the protein complex eIF4F, which is involved in the recognition of the
CC       mRNA cap, ATP-dependent unwinding of 5'-terminal secondary structure
CC       and recruitment of mRNA to the ribosome (By similarity). This protein
CC       recognizes and binds the 7-methylguanosine (m7G)-containing mRNA cap
CC       during an early step in the initiation of protein synthesis and
CC       facilitates ribosome binding by inducing the unwinding of the mRNAs
CC       secondary structures (PubMed:7939721). Together with EIF4G1,
CC       antagonizes the scanning promoted by EIF1-EIF4G1 and is required for
CC       TISU translation, a process where the TISU element recognition makes
CC       scanning unnecessary (By similarity). In addition to its role in
CC       translation initiation, also acts as a regulator of translation and
CC       stability in the cytoplasm (PubMed:8558852). Component of the CYFIP1-
CC       EIF4E-FMR1 complex which binds to the mRNA cap and mediates
CC       translational repression: in the complex, EIF4E mediates the binding to
CC       the mRNA cap. Component of a multiprotein complex that sequesters and
CC       represses translation of proneurogenic factors during neurogenesis (By
CC       similarity). In P-bodies, component of a complex that mediates the
CC       storage of translationally inactive mRNAs in the cytoplasm and prevents
CC       their degradation (By similarity). May play an important role in
CC       spermatogenesis through translational regulation of stage-specific
CC       mRNAs during germ cell development (PubMed:8558852). As well as its
CC       roles in translation, also involved in mRNA nucleocytoplasmic transport
CC       (By similarity). Its role in mRNA export from the nucleus to the
CC       cytoplasm relies on its ability to bind the m7G cap of RNAs and on the
CC       presence of the 50-nucleotide EIF4E sensitivity element (4ESE) in the
CC       3'UTR of sensitive transcripts (By similarity). Interaction with the
CC       4ESE is mediated by LRPPRC which binds simultaneously to both EIF4E and
CC       the 4ESE, thereby acting as a platform for assembly for the RNA export
CC       complex (By similarity). EIF4E-dependent mRNA export is independent of
CC       ongoing protein or RNA synthesis and is also NFX1-independent but is
CC       XPO1-dependent with LRPPRC interacting with XPO1 to form an EIF4E-
CC       dependent mRNA export complex (By similarity). Alters the composition
CC       of the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore to promote RNA export by
CC       reducing RANBP2 expression, relocalizing nucleoporin NUP214 and
CC       increasing expression of RANBP1 and RNA export factors DDX19 and GLE1.
CC       Promotes the nuclear export of cyclin CCND1 mRNA (By similarity).
CC       Promotes the nuclear export of NOS2/iNOS mRNA (By similarity). Promotes
CC       the nuclear export of MDM2 mRNA (By similarity). Also promotes the
CC       export of additional mRNAs, including others involved in the cell cycle
CC       (By similarity). In the nucleus, binds to capped splice factor-encoding
CC       mRNAs and stimulates their nuclear export to enhance splice factor
CC       production by increasing their cytoplasmic availability to the
CC       translation machinery (By similarity). May also regulate splicing
CC       through interaction with the spliceosome in an RNA and m7G cap-
CC       dependent manner (By similarity). Also binds to some pre-mRNAs and may
CC       play a role in their recruitment to the spliceosome (By similarity).
CC       Promotes steady-state capping of a subset of coding and non-coding RNAs
CC       by mediating nuclear export of capping machinery mRNAs including RNMT,
CC       RNGTT and RAMAC to enhance their translation (By similarity).
CC       Stimulates mRNA 3'-end processing by promoting the expression of
CC       several core cleavage complex factors required for mRNA cleavage and
CC       polyadenylation, and may also have a direct effect through its
CC       interaction with the CPSF3 cleavage enzyme (By similarity). Rescues
CC       cells from apoptosis by promoting activation of serine/threonine-
CC       protein kinase AKT1 through mRNA export of NBS1 which potentiates AKT1
CC       phosphorylation and also through mRNA export of AKT1 effectors,
CC       allowing for increased production of these proteins (By similarity).

CC   -!- SUBUNIT: eIF4F is a multi-subunit complex, the composition of which
CC       varies with external and internal environmental conditions (By
CC       similarity). It is composed of at least EIF4A, EIF4E and EIF4G1/EIF4G3.
CC       EIF4E is also known to interact with other partners (By similarity).
CC       Interacts with EIF4ENIF1/4E-T; promotes recruitment to P-bodies and
CC       import into the nucleus. Hypophosphorylated EIF4EBP1, EIF4EBP2 and
CC       EIF4EBP3 compete with EIF4G1/EIF4G3 to interact with EIF4E; insulin
CC       stimulated MAP-kinase (MAPK1 and MAPK3) phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1
CC       causes dissociation of the complex allowing EIF4G1/EIF4G3 to bind and
CC       consequent initiation of translation. Interacts mutually exclusive with
CC       EIF4A1 or EIF4A2 (PubMed:7939721). Interacts with NGDN and PIWIL2.
CC       Component of the CYFIP1-EIF4E-FMR1 complex composed of CYFIP, EIF4E and
CC       FMR1. Interacts directly with CYFIP1. Interacts with CLOCK (By
CC       similarity). Binds to MKNK2 in nucleus. Interacts with LIMD1, WTIP and
CC       AJUBA. Interacts with APOBEC3G in an RNA-dependent manner. Interacts
CC       with LARP1. Interacts with METTL3. Interacts with RBM24; this
CC       interaction prevents EIF4E from binding to p53/TP53 mRNA and inhibits
CC       the assembly of translation initiation complex. Interacts with DDX3X;
CC       interaction is direct and in an RNA-independent manner; this
CC       interaction enhances EIF4E cap-binding ability and is required for the
CC       repression of cap-dependent translation and the increase of IRES-
CC       mediated translation. DDX3X competes with EIF4G1 for interaction with
CC       EIF4E (By similarity). Interacts with EIF4G1; which in a mutual
CC       exclusive interaction associates either with EIF1 or with EIF4E on a
CC       common binding site (By similarity). Interacts with BTG4 and CNOT7 (By
CC       similarity). Interacts with LRPPRC (via N-terminus); the interaction
CC       promotes association of EIF4E with 4ESE-containing mRNAs (By
CC       similarity). Interacts with mRNA cleavage enzyme CPSF3 and its cofactor
CC       CPSF1 (By similarity). Interacts (via RING-type zinc finger) with PML;
CC       the interaction results in conformational changes of both interacting
CC       proteins and reduces EIF4E affinity for the 5' m7G cap of mRNA, thus
CC       reducing EIF4E-mediated mRNA nuclear export (By similarity). Interacts
CC       with homeobox protein HHEX/PRH; the interaction inhibits EIF4E-mediated
CC       mRNA nuclear export (By similarity). Interacts with homeobox protein
CC       HOXA9; the interaction positively regulates EIF4E-mediated mRNA nuclear
CC       export (By similarity). Interacts with homeobox protein EMX2 (By
CC       similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P06730,
