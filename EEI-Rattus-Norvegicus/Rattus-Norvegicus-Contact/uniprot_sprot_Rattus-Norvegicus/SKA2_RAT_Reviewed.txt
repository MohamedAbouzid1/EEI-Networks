CC   -!- FUNCTION: Component of the SKA complex, a microtubule plus end-binding
CC       complex of the outer kinetochore that stabilizes spindle microtubule-
CC       kinetochore attachments, promotes alignment of chromosomes at the
CC       mitotic spindle equator (chromosome congression) and assists
CC       suppression of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Kinetochores,
CC       consisting of a centromere-associated inner segment and a microtubule-
CC       contacting outer segment, play a crucial role in chromosome segregation
CC       by mediating the physical connection between centromeric DNA and
CC       spindle microtubules. The outer kinetochore is made up of the ten-
CC       subunit KMN network complex, comprising the MIS12, NDC80 and KNL1
CC       complexes, and auxiliary microtubule-associated components such as the
CC       SKA complex; together they connect the outer kinetochore with the inner
CC       kinetochore, bind microtubules, and mediate interactions with mitotic
CC       checkpoint proteins that delay anaphase until chromosomes are
CC       bioriented on the spindle. The SKA complex is loaded onto bioriented
CC       kinetochores and it facilitates chromosome congression by stabilizing
CC       microtubules together with MAPRE1, and end-on attachment of the NDC80
CC       complex to depolymerizing spindle microtubules, thereby assisting the
CC       poleward-moving kinetochore in withstanding microtubule pulling forces.
CC       The complex associates with dynamic microtubule plus-ends and can track
CC       both depolymerizing and elongating microtubules. The complex recruits
CC       protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to the kinetochore in prometaphase and
CC       metaphase, to oppose spindle assembly checkpoint signaling and promote
CC       the onset of anaphase. Binds directly to microtubules; but with a much
CC       lower affinity than SKA1 (By similarity). During meiosis the SKA
CC       complex stabilizes the meiotic spindle and is required for its
CC       migration to the cortex (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8WVK7,
CC       ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9CR46}.
CC   -!- SUBUNIT: Component of the SKA complex, composed of SKA1, SKA2 and SKA3.
CC       The SKA complex is a homodimer organized around a central W-shaped
CC       coiled-coil structure, formed by the interacting domains of SKA1, SKA2,
CC       and SKA3, each end of the 'W' is extended further by the C-terminal
CC       microtubule-binding domains of SKA1 and SKA3; the complex forms
CC       extended structures on microtubules. May interact with NR3C1; the
CC       relevance of such interaction remains unclear in vivo. Interacts with
CC       the MIS12 complex subunit DSN1. Interacts with the NDC80 complex; the
CC       interaction is required to establish kinetochore-microtubule end-on
CC       attachments. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8WVK7}.
CC   -!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, spindle
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8WVK7}. Chromosome, centromere, kinetochore
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8WVK7}. Cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, microtubule
CC       organizing center, centrosome {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8WVK7}.
CC       Note=Localizes to bioriented kinetochores and spindle microtubules
CC       during prometaphase and metaphase in a NDC80 complex-dependent manner
CC       (By similarity). The SKA complex begins to concentrate at kinetochores
CC       before microtubule attachment but reaches maximum levels on bioriented
CC       metaphase chromosomes (By similarity). Localizes both to microtubule
CC       plus-ends and along the length of microtubules (By similarity). The
CC       localization of the SKA complex to kinetochores is positively regulated
CC       by protein serine/threonine kinase CDK1 (By similarity). The
CC       localization of the SKA complex to kinetochores is negatively regulated
CC       by protein serine/threonine kinase AURKB, and this action is opposed
CC       directly or indirectly by the PP1 and PP2A protein phosphatase
CC       complexes (By similarity). Localizes at the centrosome during
CC       interphase and prophase (By similarity). Localizes to the meiotic
CC       spindle, but not to kinetochores, from the stage of germinal vesicle
CC       breakdown (GVBD) to meiosis II (MII) (By similarity).
CC       {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8WVK7, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9CR46}.
CC   -!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the SKA2 family. {ECO:0000305}.
