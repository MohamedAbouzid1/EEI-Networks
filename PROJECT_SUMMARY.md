# EEI Conservation Project: Executive Summary

## Project Overview

This thesis project implements a comprehensive three-pipeline approach for constructing and expanding Human Exon-Exon Interaction (EEI) networks through evolutionary conservation analysis. The work extends the original research on cancer-related protein complex interface aberrations by leveraging structural data from multiple eukaryote species and orthology relationships.

## Research Motivation

**Original Research**: "Prognostic importance of splicing-triggered aberrations of protein complex interfaces in cancer" by Khalique Newaz, Jan Baumbach and Dmitrij Frishman

**Extension**: This project addresses the limitation of direct human EEI detection by implementing a conservation-based approach that leverages evolutionary relationships to expand human EEI networks beyond what can be detected from human structural data alone.

## Methodology Summary

### Pipeline 1: Human EEI Network Construction
**Objective**: Establish baseline human EEI network using three complementary detection methods

**Methods**:
1. **Contact-based**: Physical interaction detection using PDB structures
2. **PISA-based**: Energy-stable interface detection using thermodynamic analysis
3. **EPPIC-based**: Evolutionarily conserved interface detection

**Output**: High-confidence human EEI network combining all three methods

### Pipeline 2: Species-Specific EEI Networks
**Objective**: Construct EEI networks for 7 selected eukaryote species

**Species Selection**: Based on PDB structure abundance and evolutionary diversity:
- Mus musculus (Mouse)
- Bos taurus (Cattle) 
- Drosophila melanogaster (Fruit fly)
- Gallus gallus (Chicken)
- Oryctolagus cuniculus (Rabbit)
- Rattus norvegicus (Rat)
- Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Yeast)

**Implementation**: Same three-method approach as human for each species

### Pipeline 3: Orthology Mapping and EEI Prediction
**Objective**: Expand human EEI networks through evolutionary conservation

**Components**:
1. **EGIO Analysis**: Detect orthologous exons between human and each species
2. **Orthology Mapping**: Map orthologous exons and transfer EEIs
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Assign reliability metrics based on conservation patterns
4. **Validation**: Cross-validate predictions against known human EEIs

## Key Innovations

1. **Multi-Method Integration**: Combines three complementary EEI detection approaches
2. **Evolutionary Conservation**: Leverages orthology to expand human EEI networks
3. **Cross-Species Validation**: Uses multiple species for robust predictions
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Provides reliability metrics for predicted interactions
5. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Statistical evaluation and visualization of results
