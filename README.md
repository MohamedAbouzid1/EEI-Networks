# EEI-Networks: Conservation-Based Exon-Exon Interaction Detection

This repository contains a comprehensive five-pipeline approach for constructing and expanding Human Exon-Exon Interaction (EEI) networks through evolutionary conservation analysis. The work extends the original research on cancer-related protein complex interface aberrations by leveraging structural data from multiple eukaryote species.

## Original Research
**"Prognostic importance of splicing-triggered aberrations of protein complex interfaces in cancer"** by *Khalique Newaz, Jan Baumbach and Dmitrij Frishman*

## Project Overview

This thesis project implements a comprehensive approach to expand human EEI networks beyond direct detection by leveraging evolutionary conservation patterns across multiple species. The project includes:

### Pipeline Structure

#### 1. Human Baseline (`EEI-Homo-Sapiens/`)
- EEI-networks of Homo Sapiens built using UniProt data updated to October 2024
- Three complementary detection methods: Contact-based, PISA-based, and EPPIC-based
- High-confidence combined network generation

#### 2. Species Networks (`EEI-[Species]/`)
- EEI networks for 7 eukaryote species: Mouse, Cattle, Fruit fly, Chicken, Rabbit, Rat, and Yeast
- Each species includes EGIO orthology detection
- Species-specific orthology-based EEI prediction analysis in `human_EEI_prediction/` folders
- High-confidence network generation for each species

#### 3. Species-Specific Orthology Analysis (`EEI-[Species]/human_EEI_prediction/`)
- Orthology-based EEI prediction algorithms for each species
- Analysis and evaluation tools for prediction accuracy
- Results from multiple detection methods (Contact, PISA, EPPIC)

#### 4. Comprehensive Analysis (`final_statistics/`)
- EEI network statistics and method comparisons
- EGIO orthology analysis and evolutionary divergence studies
- Phylogenetic analysis and network visualizations
- Overlap analysis and Venn diagram generation

#### 5. Mouse RNA-seq Analysis (`mm_RNA_seq_data/`)
- Survival analysis based on EEI networks
- Expression correlation analysis
- Cancer-related protein expression studies
- Treatment response analysis
