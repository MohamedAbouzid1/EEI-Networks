# EEI-Networks
This repository contains scripts to generate data and results in a research focus on the detection of exon-exon interactions, with the aim of getting wider knowledge of human EEI-networks used in the following paper:

**Prognostic importance of splicing-triggered aberrations of protein complex interfaces in cancer** by *Khalique Newaz, Jan Baumbach and Dmitrij Frishman*

In order to accomplish the task, three approaches have been used, divided in the three folders explained as follows:

#### EEI-Homo-Sapiens-2024
+ EEI-networks of Homo Sapiens are built using UniProt data updated to October 2024, while in the paper data from 2022 are used.

#### EEI-Mus-Musculus
+ EEI-networks of Mus Musculus are built. Using **EGIO**, a method for detection of orthologous exons between species, EEI in Mus musculus are then compared to those in Homo Sapiens (data from 2024).

Each folder contains the scripts required for running each analysis: they are numbered and should be executed in the ascending order.
